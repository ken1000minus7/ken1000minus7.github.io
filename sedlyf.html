		Welcome to the not so official website of the seddest bot, SedLyf. This bot was created as a result of someone not having anything better to do. This bot is as purposeless as our lives. Just as we all want our lives to be meaningful, our initiative and goal is to make this bot a meaningful bot so that it can finally be happy from the sedness that exists within it.
