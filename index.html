		Welcome to the not so official website of the seddest bot, SedLyf. This bot was created as a result of someone not having anything better to do. This bot is as purposeless as our lives. Just as we all want our lives to be meaningful, our initiative and goal is to make this bot a meaningful bot so that it can finally be happy from the sedness that exists within it.

		How to add this bot?
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="info" id="info1">
		There isn't much reason why you should add this bot to your discord server but you don't have any reason to live either. So add this meaningless bot to your server to enjoy relatable and sed quotes as well as random gifs. SedLyf would be really happy to be with someone for the first time! So just click on the link below!

		Since the makers of this bot are noobs just like most of the people using this bot, the source code of this bot is freely available to all. You can look into it and learn from it (there's not anything worth learning though) or you can suggest improvements in our feedback section. Click on the link below!
